# Connect3D

Multiplayer Connect 4 with a 3D twist.

### Project

The project is currently live on Heroku at [http://connect3d.herokuapp.com/](connect3d.herokuapp.com/). Feel free to jump into matchmaking.

#### Upcoming Features

The following features are being prioritized (at my discretion).

- Rotation over phi axis and zoom
- Highlighted win streak
- Notification on move

Later on we should have these as well. Due to popular demand:

- Names
- Chat
- Connection timeouts
